<h3> About Gabby</h3>
<div class = "list">
<ul>
    <li>8th Grader, 14 years old</li>
    <li> She is a student at APS</li>
    <li> Uses a Chromebook in school, but only has her iPhone X at home</li>
    <li> Very short attention span, used to watching 5-15 second funny compilation videos on youtube and tik tok</li>
    <li>Interested in technology/coding, but little to no resources in her school and community to help her access this knowledge</li>
    <li> She will use this site over the next few years on her iPhone X to stay in contact with me, send me her projects/coding assignments she is working on, and to look at opportunities for field trips, classes, camps, and websites that will teach her about technology and coding so she can continue learning even if APS does not have a technology class for her</li>
    <li> Frustrations may be lack of access to a computer except at school, no one to help her with questions/problems she may encounter</li>
</ul>
