My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:
</h1>

<!-- Making everything into a list -->

<ul class ="list">

<!-- Welcome -->
    <li>
    Welcome: A brief introduction that clearly states my name (Ms. Dixie/Ms. Cooper) and about what I envision this website could be for my students.
    </li>

<!-- About -->
    <li>
    About This Page: In this section I will have information about who I am, where I have taught, and what my passion and vision is for the page.  My vision is to have a place where my students can come to connect with me and engage in the technology community using the resources I post.  Will have a list of all the things they can do on the website (send me a message, read about coding/technology resources I post, engage in activities/challenges I post from websites like code.org and common sense media).
    </li>

<!-- Portfolio -->
    <li>
Portfolio: In this section there will be examples of work I have done, work my students have completed in my class, etc.  This section will be used as a place for students to look at examples of html, css, and javascript that they can look back on whenever they want to help them with the coding challenges I will post for them to try.
    </li>

<!-- Contact -->
    <li>
Contact: This section will contain a contact form where my students can put their name, email(?), when they had me as a teacher and what class, a place to write a message to me about what they have been up to, and any questions or feedback they have of what kind of content they would want me to post.
    </li>

    <!-- Photo Gallery -->
    <li>
    Photo Gallery: Photos of students/student work that is either flipping through on its own or the user can press an arrow and the pictures will change.  I have photo releases for the students I would be putting on the website.
    </li>

<!-- Challenges -->
    <li>
Challenges: This is where I will post links to code.org projects, field trips, camps, any technology related info that I would want to share with my students if I was still in the classroom with them.
    </li>
